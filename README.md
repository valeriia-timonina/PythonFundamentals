# Python Essential Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains a collection of commonly used Python programs with various algorithms and data structures, developed as a part of my university coursework.

HW1: Calculator with various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), modulus, power, and square root. It also includes a custom function called "magic" that performs a more complex calculation involving multiple parameters.

HW2: Program calculates the value of Pi using three different mathematical methods: Leibniz's Formula, Nilakantha's Series and Newton's Method.

HW3: Program performs polynomial operations such as evaluation, addition, and multiplication.
